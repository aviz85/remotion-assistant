# Speech Writing Template

## Structure Overview

Every compelling speech follows an emotional arc:

```
HOOK (5-10s) → BUILD (30-45s) → PEAK (20-30s) → RESOLVE (15-25s)
```

## Template: Inspirational Tech Speech

```
[dramatic pause] Listen.

[slowly, with weight] There's a moment... [pause] when everything changes.

[building intensity] When the tools you use... start thinking for themselves.
When code writes itself. [pause] When problems solve themselves.
When the impossible... [long pause] becomes inevitable.

[emphatic] That moment? [pause] It's now.

[warm, conversational] I used to spend hours debugging.
Days refactoring. [matter-of-fact] Weeks building features that should take minutes.

[building] But then something shifted.
Something fundamental.
Something [pause] revolutionary.

[emphatic, slower] An agent that doesn't just assist.
It [pause] thinks.
It [pause] learns.
It [pause] creates.

[excited] It stacks skills like building blocks.
Compounds intelligence like interest.
Grows capabilities [faster] exponentially.

[warm] And suddenly...
[pause]
[slowly, with weight] You're not fighting the code anymore.

[hopeful] You're dancing with it.
Collaborating with something that understands.
Building at the speed of thought.

[emphatic] This is the future.
[pause]
[warm, descending] And the future... is already here.

## Template: Product Launch Speech

```
[matter-of-fact] You've seen promises before.
[pause] We all have.

[building cynicism] "Revolutionary." "Game-changing." "Paradigm shift."
[pause]
[whisper] Words that lost their meaning.

[emphatic] But what if... [pause] just this once...
[dramatic] They actually meant something?

[excited, building] What if I told you
that everything you know about [topic]
is about to become... [pause] obsolete?

[warm] Not in years. Not in months.
[emphatic] Right now. [pause] Today.

[building] Picture this:
[describe benefit 1 - slowly, with weight]
[describe benefit 2 - faster, excited]
[describe benefit 3 - emphatic]

[pause]
[matter-of-fact] Sounds impossible?
[warm] I thought so too.
[long pause]
[emphatic] Until I tried it.

[hopeful, building] This is [product name].
And this... [pause]
[slowly, with weight] changes everything.

## Template: Educational Explainer

```
[warm, conversational] Let me tell you something
most people get wrong about [topic].

[pause]
[matter-of-fact] They think it's complicated.
[whisper] It's not.

[building] The secret is actually... [pause] simple.
[emphatic] Embarrassingly simple.

[excited] Here's what happens:
[explain step 1 - slowly, deliberate]
[explain step 2 - building pace]
[explain step 3 - faster, confident]

[pause]
[warm] That's it. [pause] Really.

[matter-of-fact] Now, here's where it gets interesting...

[building intensity] When you combine these three things,
something magical happens.
[emphatic] Something most people never discover.

[pause]
[hopeful] You stop [old way of doing things].
[excited] And you start [new way].

[warm, descending] And once you see it...
[slowly] You can never unsee it.
```

## Writing Tips

1. **Front-load the hook** - First 5 seconds must grab attention
2. **Use concrete language** - Specific > abstract
3. **Vary sentence length** - Short punchy. Then longer flowing sentences that build momentum.
4. **Strategic pauses** - Let important moments breathe
5. **End strong** - Final line should be memorable
6. **Read aloud** - If it sounds awkward, rewrite it

## Word Counts by Duration

| Duration | Words | Good For |
|----------|-------|----------|
| 30 sec | 60-80 | Social clips |
| 60 sec | 120-150 | Quick explainers |
| 90 sec | 180-220 | Product intros |
| 2 min | 240-300 | Full narratives |
| 3 min | 360-450 | Deep dives |

## Emphasis Word Selection

Mark 5-10% of words as emphasis words in your storyboard:
- Key concepts
- Product names
- Emotional peaks
- Surprising words
- Call to action verbs
